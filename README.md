### Blockchain-Based Legal Compliance Management System

I'll create a simple blockchain-based legal compliance management system using Clarity smart contracts. This system will help regulated businesses track and prove their compliance with legal requirements.

## Smart Contracts

```markdown project="Blockchain-Based Legal Compliance Management" file="PR-DETAILS.md"
...
```

### Requirement Tracking Contract

Records applicable legal obligations for entities.

```plaintext
;; Add a new legal requirement
(define-public (add-requirement
    (requirement-id (string-ascii 64))
    (title (string-ascii 100))
    (description (string-utf8 500))
    (jurisdiction (string-ascii 50))
    (category (string-ascii 50))
    (effective-date uint)
    (expiry-date (optional uint)))
  ...)

;; Assign a requirement to an entity
(define-public (assign-requirement
    (entity-id (string-ascii 64))
    (requirement-id (string-ascii 64)))
  ...)
```

### Implementation Contract

Manages compliance activities for entities.

```plaintext
;; Record a compliance implementation
(define-public (record-implementation
    (entity-id (string-ascii 64))
    (requirement-id (string-ascii 64))
    (implementation-id (string-ascii 64))
    (title (string-ascii 100))
    (description (string-utf8 500))
    (responsible-party principal))
  ...)
```

### Documentation Contract

Records evidence of compliance.

```plaintext
;; Submit a compliance document
(define-public (submit-document
    (entity-id (string-ascii 64))
    (requirement-id (string-ascii 64))
    (document-id (string-ascii 64))
    (title (string-ascii 100))
    (description (string-utf8 500))
    (document-hash (buff 32))
    (document-type (string-ascii 50)))
  ...)

;; Verify document hash
(define-read-only (verify-document-hash 
    (entity-id (string-ascii 64))
    (requirement-id (string-ascii 64))
    (document-id (string-ascii 64))
    (hash-to-verify (buff 32)))
  ...)
```

### Audit Trail Contract

Maintains an immutable record of compliance activities.

```plaintext
;; Record an audit event
(define-public (record-event
    (entity-id (string-ascii 64))
    (event-type (string-ascii 50))
    (related-id (string-ascii 64))
    (description (string-utf8 500)))
  ...)
```

## Usage Flow

1. **Entity Registration**: Regulated businesses are verified and registered on the blockchain
2. **Requirement Assignment**: Legal requirements are assigned to relevant entities
3. **Implementation**: Entities implement compliance measures and record them
4. **Documentation**: Evidence of compliance is submitted and verified
5. **Audit**: All activities are automatically recorded in the audit trail


## Testing

Tests are implemented using Vitest. Run the tests with:

```shellscript
npm test
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Clarity language knowledge
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts


### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run tests: `npm test`

## System Architecture

Here's a diagram showing how the different contracts in the system interact:

```mermaid title="Compliance Management System Architecture" type="diagram"

    C["Requirement Tracking Contract"] -->|"Assigns to"| B
    C -->|"Defines"| D["Legal Requirements"]

    G["Audit Trail Contract"] -->|"Records all events from"| A

    G -->|"Records all events from"| F
```

## Key Features

This blockchain-based legal compliance management system provides several key features:

1. **Immutable Record Keeping**: All compliance activities are recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable audit trail.
2. **Transparency**: Regulators and auditors can verify compliance activities without relying on centralized record-keeping.
3. **Efficiency**: Automates compliance tracking and reporting, reducing administrative overhead.
4. **Proof of Compliance**: Provides cryptographic proof that compliance activities were performed.
5. **Decentralization**: Removes the need for trusted third parties to verify compliance.
